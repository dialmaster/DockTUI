# DockerView Configuration File
# This file controls various settings for the DockerView application

# Application Settings
app:
  # Refresh interval in seconds for updating container status
  # Lower values update more frequently but use more resources
  # Default: 5.0
  refresh_interval: 5.0

# Log Display Settings
log:
  # Maximum number of log lines to keep in memory per container/stack
  # Higher values use more memory but allow viewing more history
  # Default: 4000
  max_lines: 4000

  # Number of log lines to initially fetch when viewing a container/stack
  # Lower values load faster but show less history
  # Default: 200
  tail: 200

  # Time range of logs to fetch (e.g., '15m', '1h', '24h')
  # Only logs from this time period will be shown initially
  # This significantly improves performance for long-running containers
  # Default: '15m'
  since: '15m'

# Note: You can also override these settings with environment variables:
# - DOCKERVIEW_APP_REFRESH_INTERVAL
# - DOCKERVIEW_LOG_MAX_LINES
# - DOCKERVIEW_LOG_TAIL
# - DOCKERVIEW_LOG_SINCE
